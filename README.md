# Dashboard 1:
1. Bikes were most frequently used in Jersey City and Hoboken, with lower usage east of the Hudson River despite the area's large population.


2. Summer 2024 had more station locations than 2023, indicating users are expanding geographically.


3. There is little difference in popularity between start and end stations, though there are more end stations, suggesting users tend to begin trips at hubs and end in more dispersed locations.

# Dashboard 2: 

1. Electric bike usage has surged in just six months, while classic bikes have declined. E-bikes offer greater speed and range, enhancing convenience.


2. Monthly ridership has grown from 6,668 in September 2015 to 111,115 in June 2024, with demand rising as the program expands.


3. Hoboken Terminal and Grove St. PATH are the most popular start and end stations, likely due to their connections to other transit hubs.

# Dashboard 3:

1. Peak ride times are 6 PM in summer and 5 PM in winter, with earlier rides more common in winter.


2. 8 AM is also a peak time year-round, suggesting many riders use bikes for commuting.


3. Bike usage is much higher in summer, highlighting weather's impact. Given the reliance on bikes for commuting, offering alternatives during bad weather may be beneficial.

# Dashboard 4:

1. Both casual users and members increased over the last 9 years, but casual users grew 24x compared to 14x for members.


2. Casual users consistently take longer trips than members, likely due to the lower per-trip cost for members.


3. Membership ($4.79 per ride vs. $219.99 per year) is best for frequent riders. The rise of e-bikes and new locations may boost membership growth.
